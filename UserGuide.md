# Download & Installation
You can download the application from the [Release tab](https://github.com/kdesantis/AdminLauncher/releases).
Choose the one that's right for you (Framework-dependent dependent framework requires installation of .net 8, others are self-contained). 
Once you have downloaded the archive,
extract it to a directory and run the executable **“AdminLauncher.AppWPF.exe”**

**Home pannel** contains a button for all added programs and routines. 
Each button has a **context menu** accessible by right-clicking to **edit** or **delete** the program.

The ordering of the buttons follows this logic:
1. First the routines in alphabetical order,
2. the programs signed as favorites in alphabetical order
3. the rest of the programs in alphabetical order

To launch a program or routine, just left-click.

**Be careful**, if you try to close the application it **will not close** but will be hidden, 
to show it just **double click** on the icon in the task bar. To close the application 
permanently right click on the icon in the task bar and select “Close” in the menu.
